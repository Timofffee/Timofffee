## About

Hi. I'm George. I love playing games and making games. <br/>
I like to learn something new and expand my horizons. <br/>
Besides that, I love composing music.


## Projects
_Lately I've been working a lot on closed projects, so my activity is poorly visible. <br/>
But I try to find the time to contribute._

### [Story Generator Bot](https://github.com/Timofffee/StoryGeneratorBot)
A simple fun project that was aimed at the first trial of the Go language.<br/> 
The main point is to create a whole sentence from different passages. <br/>
Sometimes it turns out to be extremely fun. <br/>
The most important thing is to dilute the situation in the conversation a little.

At the moment, the development is stopped, but I will come back to it.
